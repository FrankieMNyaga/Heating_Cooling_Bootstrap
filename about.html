                <h4 class="about-content">Established in 2017, Akram’s Heating & Cooling LLC began simply as just an HVAC company. The company was founded by Idris Akram as he built up the company while carrying out each work order single-handedly. During this time Mr. Akram also worked full time as a Regional Chief of Engineering for Hilton Hotels where he excelled tremendously. Mr. Akram envisioned a life where he could solely work for himself so during this time of his life he began to invest his all into Akram's Heating & Cooling LLC. As the years went on he'd expanded his company into a much broader horizon and has since been able to offer a host of other services in the Maintenance industry. Although this company began as a one man show we have grown into a family and plan to continue expanding in the near future. 
                    We know that superior service accompanies lifelong customers and we've built an outstanding customer rapport. Over the years our company has excelled at a remarkable rate in comparison to the original launch of the brand. Our technicians understand Greater Cleveland's demanding climate and can handle any HVAC need, including furnaces, boilers, air conditioners, air quality, hot water solutions, and more.
